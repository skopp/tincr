Until further notice, \r\n#use [Ryan Ackley's Bitbucket repo](http://goo.gl/XQ24x) instead as it has been abused and is much more active\r\n\r\n***\r\n \r\n## _'So What Is This Then?'_\r\n==============================\r\nThis repo serves a dual-purpose. First, just a word on its background/source:\r\n\r\nBKG\r\n===\r\nThis is simply a clone of _Ryan Ackley's [tincr](http://goo.gl/XQ24x)repo on Bitbucket_ - just githubbed for convenience.\r\n\r\n###'Why duplicate instead of collaborate?'\r\n1. As mentioned - for the sake of (in?)convenience. Some prefer Github over Bibucket. Or App Engine over Mercurial. Mercurial over Github, Gitorious over Github. Bazaar over everything else. I use all of those (plus many other SVN service/hosting/resource providers. This point, I feel, ties in with the next, namely\r\n2. It's primarily a _personal_ experiment, done under the watchful eye of the public. It's a project that's bigger than just this one amazing repository (once again, **credit goes to ryanackley, I just cloned his repo to Github**. \r\n\r\nMy 'project' I'll leave for another time and place. Back to Tincr now.\r\nAnd you are warned for the last time that this is a clone. If you choose to use it/fork/whatever, you implicitly acknowledge that you're aware of this, regardless of whether you have read this intro or not\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTincr\r\n=====\r\nThis is the source code for the [Tincr Chrome Extension](http://tin.cr). The docs are hosted [here](http://tin.cr/docs.html).\r\n\r\nGetting Support\r\n=======\r\nPlease seek help on the [Tincr google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tincr-for-chrome-devtools). I actively monitor this group. It's better than trying to contact me directly since other people may be experiencing the same problem and I can help everyone at once. \r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n======\r\nTincr is a chrome extension. You can simply checkout the source code and load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome. This will \r\nrequire that Chrome is in Developer Mode (go to chrome://extensions and tick the box). Alternatively, you can pack the extension yourself using Chrome. \r\n\r\n## NPAPI Chrome File API\r\nTincr relies on an NPAPI plugin (NPAPI Chrome File API) for all of it's native file support. For example, reading and writing local files from a chrome extension and watching local directories for changes. The source code for this is [here](https://bitbucket.org/ryanackley/npapi-chrome-file-api/src).","google":"UA-35561988-2"}
